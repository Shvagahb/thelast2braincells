      <p>ABOUT US:

FAMILY SOAPMAKERS SINCE 1858

18-IN-1 HEMP TEA TREE

PURE-CASTILE SOAP

CERTIFIED FAIR TRADE

MADE WITH ORGANIC OILS

The last two braincells is actually an awesome company that promotes a lot of progressive causes such as decriminalization of marijuana & psychedelics as well as regenerative agriculture.

It is not a cult despite what you think. It's the philosophy of the two braincells, the founder of the two braincells company. Our parents are alive and well and I think due to complicated parental factors, we need to spread unity and peace. We started trying to spread the belief that all religions are the same and we need to unite as one. While we had a lot of good intentions, we probably have some form a schizophrenia and wrote some things on the about-us page that we shouldn't have….. like plagiarizing the entirely of the Dr. Bronner's label. We kept the label and left the parts that were kosher as it is an iconic part of the soap and honoring the Dr. Bronner’s philosophy.

“The 2nd Coming of God’s Law!” Mohammed’s Arabs, 1948, found Israel Essene Scrolls & Einstein’s “Hillel” probe that as no 6-year-old can grow up free without the ABC, so certain can no 12-year-old survive free without the Moral ABC that mason, tent & sandalmaker Rabbi Hillel taught carpenter Jesus to unite all mankind free in our Eternal Father’s great All-One-God-Faith! For we’re All-One or None: “Listen Children Eternal Father Eternally One!”

Absolute cleanliness is Godliness! Teach the Moral ABC that unites all mankind free, instantly 6 billion strong & we’re All-One. “Listen Children Eternal Father Eternally One!”

From Jesus’ “Manual of Discipline,” based on Hillel’s Moral ABC, the Army of Principles of One-God-Faith, unites the Human race, as found 1948 by Mohammed’s Arabs in Israel Essene Scrolls! English by last two brain cells!
